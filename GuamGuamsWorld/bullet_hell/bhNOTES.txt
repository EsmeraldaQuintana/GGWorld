	Started BulletHell.tscn
	Tried to tile the background but it broke ("only used for 3d")
	Sprite added to scene looks like shit
		Took off flags Filter, Mipmaps
		Storage is Uncompressed
		Lossy Quality does nothing.
		Tested sprite under GIMP and PINTA, sprite is fine.
	Need to add collision between BH Boundaries and BH Player
